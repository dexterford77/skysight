          <strong>The Problem</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          As a pilot, you often fly in stark visual environments with extreme contrast and glare. The bright region of space in front of you often requires your eyes to adjust to an enormous decrease in brightness when you glance down to view the instruments and reading material.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What Causes Contrast?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Contrast in a jet cockpit is caused by the difference between the bright outside light and the relatively dim instrument panel. The eyes primarily adapt to the bright outside light, so the instrument panel can be too dim to see. There can also be significant contrast between the dim instrument panel and brighter reading material.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What Causes Glare?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Glare occurs when the lens of the eye scatters bright outside light when viewing the dimly lit instruments. This scattering creates an illumination that makes the instruments difficult to see. Reading material, usually brighter than the instruments, can also contribute to glare.

          <strong>Why Do Skysight<sup>®</sup> Sunglasses Work Better Than Other Sunglasses?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Conventional sunglasses</strong> have uniformly tinted lenses, and pilots typically wear darkly tinted lenses to compensate for the bright outside light. These sunglasses evenly reduce light from regions outside and inside the aircraft, so evenly tinted dark lenses may make the instrument panel too dark to see. Skysight<sup>®</sup> lenses have three distinct viewing areas: outside, the instrument panel, and reading material. Each area is separately tinted with a density that optimizes viewing conditions for its region.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Gradient sunglasses</strong> are tinted dark at the top and light at the bottom. These sunglasses are well suited for activities on or close to the ground because the gradient tint compensates for the change in brightness from the sky to the ground. However, these sunglasses are not optimally suited for flying because the pilot has to view into relatively uniform bright outside light and then view a dim instrument panel. Pilots often find these sunglasses to be insufficiently dark for outside light, too dark for the instruments, and, again, not dark enough for reading material. These sunglasses also do not compensate for the contrast between the outside light and instrument panel because they don't allow for the sharp change in brightness between these two regions. In addition, gradient sunglasses do little to mitigate glare because they allow too much outside light to enter the pilot's eyes when viewing the instrument panel. Skysight<sup>®</sup> lenses overcome contrast and reduce glare by their dark tint in all areas except those areas used to view the instrument panel and reading material.

              <strong>How Can Skysight<sup>®</sup> Sunglasses Help You?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Our patented tri-tinted pattern uses different tints to balance the light from and for three distinct viewing regions: dark tint for outside, light tint for the instruments, and moderate tint for reading material.
